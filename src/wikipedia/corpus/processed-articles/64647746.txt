Gli had only one offspring, a jet-black cat aptly named Karakız ("Black Girl").[3] Gli was loved by the tourists who visited Hagia Sophia, which was a museum at the time, and she became a symbol of Hagia Sophia. Gli first became popular when Barack Obama visited Hagia Sophia in 2009; he and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stroked Gli. After it was told that Hagia Sophia was re-opening to worship, Gli was posted all over social media and became famous again. After the news of Hagia Sophia re-opening for worship, Gli's fate was on the news as well.

That cat will be there, and all cats are welcome to our mosques."[4]

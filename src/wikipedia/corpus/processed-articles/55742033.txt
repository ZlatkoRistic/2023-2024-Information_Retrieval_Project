Paddles (2016 – 7 November 2017) was a ginger and white polydactyl cat,[1] owned by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford. Paddles had a profile on Twitter and in politics as "First Cat".
Early life[edit]
Paddles was a rescue cat, adopted by Ardern from a branch of the SPCA.
Career[edit]
She became a celebrity as the "First Cat" after Ardern took office, and a Twitter account was established in her name. Ardern said that she did not know who created the account.[2][3]
When U.S. President Donald Trump phoned Ardern to congratulate her for becoming Prime Minister in October 2017, Paddles interrupted the conversation.[4]
Death[edit]
Paddles was run over by a car and killed in the Auckland suburb of Point Chevalier on 7 November 2017.[5][6]

Freshpet is an American pet food company. Its cat food and dog food products are marketed as fresh, and need to be kept refrigerated.[4] It is listed on the Nasdaq exchange with the ticker symbol FRPT.[5]
History[edit]
Freshpet was founded in Secaucus, New Jersey, in 2006 by Scott Morris, Cathal Walsh, and John Phelps, former pet food executives.[6][7] It opened a factory in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, in 2006;[8][9] and another in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 2013.[4]
Freshpet went public on the NASDAQ in November 2014, raising $164 million in its IPO.[10][11] with a market capitalization of $447 million.[11]
In February 2020, the company was offered a grant of $2.1 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund to build a plant in Ennis, Texas.[12]
Also
In 2020, the company reported revenue of almost $319 million, an increase of some 30%, and a net income loss of $3.19 million, up 130% on the previous year. It also reported losses in the four preceding years.[1][2]
Products[edit]
Freshpet's cat food and dog food products are marketed as fresh, requiring refrigeration[4] since the company's products have no preservatives.[13] Freshpet was the first to distribute pet food in the fresh and refrigerated category across North America. After a 2007 crisis of wet and dried dog food tainted by melamine, Freshpet's uncontaminated fresh food products experienced rapid growth in the number of stores carrying them.[14][15]
As of 2021, the company's pet-food brands include Freshpet, Dog Joy, DogNation, Spring & Sprout,[16] Vital, Homestyle Creations, and Nature's Fresh.[17]

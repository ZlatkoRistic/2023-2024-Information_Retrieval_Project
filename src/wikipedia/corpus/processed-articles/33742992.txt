Fancy Feast is a brand of gourmet cat food from Nestlé Purina PetCare. Introduced by the Carnation Company in 1982, it was originally offered in seven flavors of wet food.[1]
History[edit]
In 1982, Fancy Feast was introduced in 3-ounce cans of wet food in seven different varieties. It was the first "gourmet" cat food. In its original commercial, an announcer said, "Your cat give you that cold shoulder when you serve cold, leftover cat food? Watch it warm up to Fancy Feast". It also featured a white Persian cat that talked in her thoughts. It was sold along with Friskies and other pet foods in 1985 to Nestlé, and the merger became Friskies PetCare Company.
Controversy[edit]
After reports about slave labor emerged from news outlets and nongovernmental organizations related to Purina pet foods, Nestlé launched an internal investigation into the matter in December 2014.
Their findings revealed that slave labor was present in their supply chain in Myanmar and Cambodia, where workers got trapped working on fishing vessels under inhumane conditions and for little to no pay.
Nestlé pledged to publish yearly reports and to work with suppliers to achieve a positive difference on how they source their ingredients.[2]
Slogans[edit]
"Fancy Feast, darling?" (1982)
"A moist and delicious meal in every can." (1982–1984)
"Good taste is easy to recognize." (1982–2005)[3][4][5]
"Is it love, or is it Fancy Feast?" (2005–2008)
"The best ingredient is love." (2010–present)[6]

PrettyLitter is an American pet wellness company based in Los Angeles, that produces lightweight crystal-based cat litter that is designed to react to a cat's urine to indicate potential health problems by changing color based on the acidity, alkalinity or the presence of blood in a cat's urine.[2][3] PrettyLitter also produces health-focused cat food.[4] In May 2021, PrettyLitter was acquired by Mars for a reported $1 billion.[5][2]
History[edit]
PrettyLitter was founded in 2015 by Daniel Rotman[6][7] who graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received his master's degree from Harvard University where he was a Fellow for the Center for Public Leadership. Rotman has previously worked for the U.S. Congressional Chair of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs.[8]
The idea of PrettyLitter was born after the passing of Rotman's cat, Gingi, where he discovered there were no at-home tools to help detect cats' potential health issues.[8][9][10][11]
In 2015, PrettyLitter participated in the Startup U competition led by Tim Draper, a 7-week reality television series that premiered on ABC Family from August to October 2015.[12][13] As one of the finalists for Startup U, Rotman managed to start PrettyLitter officially in late 2015.[8][14]
In August 2016, the PrettyLitter joined American startup accelerator, Gener8tor which resulted in a growing sales size of 1300 percent within two months.[15] In May 2021, Mars acquired PrettyLitter for a reported $1 billion.[2]

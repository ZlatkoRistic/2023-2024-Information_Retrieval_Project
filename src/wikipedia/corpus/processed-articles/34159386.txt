As an allegory on Germany's Nazi past, it is facile and ambivalent. The detective/narrator, Francis, an irrepressibly curious house cat, deduces that whoever is murdering the neighborhood tabbies has a warped mind and is attempting to breed a 'super race' of felines."[18] Felidae was adapted into a 1994 German animated neo-noir film directed by Michael Schaack and starring Ulrich Tukur as Francis.

Various far-future cats
"Puss in Boots"byRonald Anthony Cross
This science fiction story describes a world full of far-future cats on a planet where "cats were the closest thing to a religion that they had" and where cats "wandered freely and slept wherever they chose. There were huge communal cat boxes everywhere...filled with some form of brightly colored pellets, which automatically emptied and were refilled with more of the same stuff." The fact that cats are no longer fed actual meat is a clue to the mystery in the story, about whether men are any longer real men.[42]

Cats in fantasy are frequently humorous sidekicks; for example, in Gregory Frost's Lyrec, Borregad is an alien who takes the form of a cat and thereby has little help, besides jokes, to offer the sword and sorcery hero.

Additionally, in his new Collected Stories, 1984-1986... the fine and varied craftsman Wright Morris includes 'The Cat in the Picture', which is strikingly reminiscent of both 'The Black Cat' and 'The Oval Portrait'.
^ Barrett, Sharon (December 24, 1986). "Morris Collection Recalls Edgar Allan Poe Influence". Chicago Sun-Times. p.¬†24. A touch of the grotesque, which sometimes shades into horror, flavors many of the 26 stories in this collection. 'The Cat in the Picture,' first published in 1958, is the story of a man jealous of the attention his wife gives to a cat that decides to take up residence with them. The story, though lightened by irony, has a grim ending that seems less influenced by black humorists, in vogue at the time, than by Edgar Allan Poe.

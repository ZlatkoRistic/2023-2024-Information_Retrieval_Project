This list of fictional cats and other felines in television is subsidiary to the list of fictional cats. This list includes feline puppet characters. It is restricted solely to notable feline characters from notable live action (or primarily live-action) television programmes. For characters that appear in several separate shows, only the earliest appearance will be recorded here.
This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.

The Hermitage cats (Russian: Эрмитажные коты) are a group of cats residing in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The museum has a press secretary dedicated to the cats,[1] and three people act as caretakers.[2] The cats live in the museum's basement, and they also appear on the embankment and on the square during the summer. In previous eras, they roamed throughout the museum galleries.[3]
In 2010, Maria Khaltunen (also "Khaltunin" or "Haltunen"), who directs the museum's cat programme, stated that there were 60 cats on the museum grounds, even though the staff has a joke that officially the museum is only supposed to have 50 cats.[4] Irina Popovets, who became the head of the cat department, stated that the cats were "as well-known as our collections".[5]
In May 2013, the count had grown to 74 cats, of both sexes (but neutered), according to Haltunen.[2]
There are kitchens for preparing their food ("they all have different preferences"), and even a small hospital.[2]
As of 2013, donations (a €400-per-month payment from the charity Pro Animale, and the sponsorship of Royal Canin) fund the presence of the cats.[2]
History[edit]
The cats were present in the museum, originally a palace, since the 18th century;[1] in 1745, Elizabeth of Russia ordered cats to be placed in the palace in order to control the mice.[6] James Rodgers of the BBC stated that the belief is that the cats originated from Kazan, a city known for having cats good at catching mice. The cats remained in St. Petersburg except during World War II,[1] when the existing cat population was killed. A new group of cats replaced the previous cats, since the rat population had increased.[4]
In the late 1990s, Khaltunen began a programme to care for the cats, which previously lived in poor conditions.[6] As of 2007, the museum began adopting cats needing homes.[1]
In 2011, the museum began a "Catfest", a celebration of its cat population. "Catfest" has included cat painting contests and scavenger hunts for children.[6]
Beginning in 2015, because of the number of visiting tourists, a website has been set up by the museum for people who may be interested in adopting a cat. "It is an honor to adopt a Hermitage cat", one potential cat owner was told.[7]

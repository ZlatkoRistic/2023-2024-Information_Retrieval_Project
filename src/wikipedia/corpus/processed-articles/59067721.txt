List of ships' cats
Redirect to:Ship's cat#Notable examplesThis page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:
To a section: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to a section of a page on the subject. For redirects to embedded anchors on a page, use {{R to anchor}} instead.
To a subtopic: This is a redirect to a subtopic of the redirect's title.
If the redirect topic is detailed enough to sustain its own article, then use {{R with possibilities}} and {{R printworthy}} in addition.
If notability of the subject is supportable, then by all means be bold and convert this redirect into an article about the topic.
When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.

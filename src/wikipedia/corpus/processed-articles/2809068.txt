Cath Palug
A monstrous cat in Welsh legend
Cath Palug (also Cath Paluc, Cath Balug, Cath Balwg, literally 'Palug's cat') was a monstrous cat in Welsh legend, given birth to in Gwynedd by the pig Henwen of Cornwall; the cat was later to haunt the Isle of Anglesey, and was said to have killed 180 warriors when Sir Kay went to the island to hunt it down.
Cath Palug's French name is Chapalu (Old French and variant modern forms: Capalu, Capalus). Vicious poems were composed by Frenchmen claiming it killed King Arthur, according to a 12th-century Anglo-Norman author. A cat analogous to Chapalu (though not mentioned by name) is eradicated by Arthur in the Vulgate Cycle's prose Estoire de Merlin.
Etymology[edit]
The name Cat Palug may mean "scratching cat", but this is just one of a range of possible meanings.[1] The word palug (paluc) is theorized to have a common pal- stem, which may mean: 'hit, strike', 'cut, lop', 'scratch, claw',[2] or even 'dig, pierce'.[1][a][b]
Chapalu, the French form can be broken down into chat 'cat' + palu 'bog', hence 'the bog cat'; and in the Anglo-Norman poem (see §Li Romanz des Franceis) Chapalu and palu are connected in the story (the words are end-rhymed in the couplet).[c][4]
Aquatic nature[edit]
It was a sort of fish-cat which was the killer of King Arthur (and thus analogous to the chapalu) in a fragmentary German poem (§Manuel und Amande).[5][6] The monstrous cat of Lausanne, which was the analogue in the Vulgate Merlin started out as a black kitten caught by a fisherman in his net.[7]
The Cath Palug is always localised nearby water ; lake of Bourget and Lake of Geneva in France, the sea in Wales (See §Localisation).
Welsh sources[edit]
Cath Palug is mentioned in just two works among early Welsh sources, the triads and a fragmentary poem.[4]
Triads[edit]
Cath Palug's birth origins are given in "The Powerful Swineherds" in the Welsh Triads (Trioedd Ynys Prydein, end of the 13th century).
According to this source, it started life as a black kitten (lit "whelp"), given birth by the great white sow Henwen at the black rock in Llanfair [cy].[d] There the kitten was cast into the sea, but it crossed the Menai Strait and was found on Ynys Môn (Angelsey), where the sons of Palug raised it, not realizing Cath Palug was to become one of the three great plagues of the island.[8][9]
Pa Gur[edit]
Cath Palug was fought and slain by Cai (Sir Kay), or so it is implied, in the incomplete poem "Pa Gur yv y Porthaur" ("What man is the porter"), found in the Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin (The Black Book of Carmarthen, written before 1250).[10] Kay had gone to destroy lleown (possibly meaning 'lions') in Môn (Anglesey). In the encounter, nine score (180) warriors were killed by the cat.[10][11][12]
The fragmentary poem states that Kay's shield is mynud against the cat, which has been construed in various ways,[e] but plausibly interpreted as "polished against Palug's cat".[13] This description coincides with the Middle English story in the Lambeth manuscript,[14] in which Arthur raises a shield (presumably mirrored) causing the cats to attack their own shadows reflected in it.[15]
Arthur's fight with the cat[edit]
Outside of Wales, the cat's opponent has been transposed to King Arthur himself.
The chapalu (capalu) is the equivalent monster in Old French and Anglo-Norman sources.[f][16][17]
Several works (mainly Old French or Anglo-Norman) relate a battle between the chapalu (or an anonymous cat) with King Arthur himself (rather than with Kay). Sometimes the beast wins, sometimes King Arthur wins.[18]
Some of the works only speak of an anonymous cat or cats, but are considered examples of chapalu encounters by commentators, due to the parallels.[g][19][20] The cat of Lausanne (Losan) that fought Arthur, in the Vulgate cycle is a notable example of the cat not being named.
The king is the victor in the Vulgate prose Merlin and in a Middle-English romance in the Lambert ms. noted above. His defeat is noted in several romances that are essentially non-Arthurian, but can be viewed as a French joke against the English, although some researchers believed some genuine tradition of an alternative death of Arthur.[21]
Li Romanz des Franceis[edit]
In the early 13th century, the Anglo-Norman poet André de Coutance rebuked the French for having written a vindictive poem (or poems[22]) describing King Arthur's death by a cat. André indignantly added that this was an utter lie.[4][23]
This passage in André's work Li Romanz des Franceis ("The Romance of the French") has been excerpted and commented in various studies.[24][25][4][26][h] André's short résumé of the French work was that Chapalu kicked Arthur into a bog, afterwards killed Arthur, swam to England and became king in his place.[4]
Manuel und Amande[edit]
A French original is thought to have existed[28] to the fragmentary, Middle German poem Manuel und Amande written between 1170 and the beginning of the 13th century. It implies that slain by a sort of a "fish-cat",[5] or strictly according to the text, it was a fish which at the same time "had the form of a cat (katze gestalt)".[29][30][32] This was considered to be a work in the same tradition as the French works that told of Arthur's dishonorable demise, such as polemicized against by André the Norman.[f][25][24]
Vulgate Merlin[edit]
L'Estoire de Merlin ("The story of Merlin", written in the 13th century). A man fishing in the lake of Lausanne swears that he will dedicate to God the first creature that he catches, but fails to keep his oath. At the third cast of his line he catches a black kitten, which he takes home, only for it to grow to gigantic proportions. The giant cat then kills the fisherman, his entire family, and subsequently any traveller unwise enough to come near the lake. It is, however, finally killed by King Arthur.[33][7]
Galeran de Bretagne[edit]
Galeran de Bretagne ("Galeran of Brittany", written in the 13th century) is another work that refers to Arthur's combat with the cat. According to the summary given by Emile Freymond [de] (and by Gaston Paris), Galeran of Brittany beats his German opponent Guynant, and the latter tries to rile up the Breton by repeating the contrueve ('idle lie') that the great cat killed Arthur in a pitched battle.[34][35]
There is some issue of dissent regarding this interpretation. The text can be read in the converse, so that the German knight says Arthur had killed the cat. Freymond noted that while this was grammatically possible, it was not an allowable interpretation in the context.[36] Gaston Paris agreed on this point.[35] However, John Beston (2008) translated the portion at issue as "the proverb about King Arthur killing the cat".[37]
Spanish chivalric romance[edit]
The oldest chivalric romance in Spanish, The Book of the Knight Zifar speaks of a perilous situation figuratively, as tantamount to King Arthur facing the Gato Paul, which is considered a reference to King Arthur fighting the monstrous cat.[i][38]
Other heroes[edit]
The chapalu is encountered by heroes from the Charlemagne cycle, in either late interpolations or later prose sequels to the original chanson de geste.
La Bataille Loquifer[edit]
Chapalu is fought by the knight Rainouart in a late version of La Bataille Loquifer [fr] in the Guillaume d'Orange cycle (aka La Geste de Garin de Monglane). The epic originally written c. 1170 did not contain the episode, but a late-13th century interpolation to it introduced Arthurian elements.[39]
An extract containing the chapalu portion was published by Antoine Le Roux de Lincy in 1836,[40][j] Paulin Paris wrote summaries based on a different manuscript.[k]
Chapalu here was the son born after the lutin Gringalet[l][m] raped the fée Brunehold[n] while she bathed in the fountain of Oricon. Although Chapalu was beautiful, his mother could not bear her shame and turned him into a hideously shaped monster, and this curse could only be lifted when he has sucked a few drops of Rainouart's blood.[42][44]
The description of the Chapalu after his metamorphosis was that he had a cat's head with red eyes,[45] a horse's body, a griffon's talons (or dragon's feet),[42] and a lion's tail.[44][46][47]
Rainouart is then brought to Avalon by three fées,[48] and Arthur the king of Avalon commands Chapalu to fight this newcomer. In the ensuing battle, Chapalu laps some blood from his opponent's heel, and his human form is restored.[49][44]
Ogier[edit]
Ogier the Dane appears in Jean d'Outremeuse's Ly Myreur des Histors where he fights the chapalu (turns out to be the metamorphosis of his squire Benoit, or else the monster from which Benoit's soul must be liberated).[50][51][52] The narrative is similar to Renoart's Avalon adventure according to La Bataille Loquifer, [51] and there is "no doubt" Jean knew the chanson in question.[52]
According to the Myreur, Ogier was traveling in the year 896 to succor Guillaume d'Orange when he was shipwrecked with his horse Passevent on an isle (Ysle de Trist, 9 days sailing from Cyprus), and combats with the Chapalu (capalu).[51] A fight ensues between Ogier and beasts, including the Chapalu, but this is actually Ogier's squire Benoit (or his soul) trapped in monster form due to enchantment, and Ogier is required to tap the creature between the eyes to lift the curse. Ogier subsequently fights Arthur and Gawain, until Morgan le Fay is summoned by her son Auberon (Alberon) to interrupt the fight.[51][50]
A similar narrative is incorporated into late reworked versions of the Ogier romance (except Gawain goes without mention).[51] The reworkings (or Rifacimenti) exist in decasyllabic form (Rifacimento A) and alexandrines (B).[50] The decasyllabic Roman d'Ogier (c. 1310) summarized by Togeby, and here too, the capalu was a knight transformed into a lutin by the fées, and he offers to become Ogier's squire.[53]
Representation[edit]
The fight between King Arthur and Cath Palug is figured on a mosaic in the Cathedral of Otranto. The creature believed to represent the Cath Palug is a spotted feline, seeming to attack King Arthur (labeled rex Arturus) mounted on some horned animal, wearing a crown, and holding a club (or sceptre).[54] The crown on Arthur and the horns on the mounting beast appear to be artefacts of the restorer, based on preserved drawings of the mosaic from earlier.[55]
Localisation[edit]
The legend about a fight between Arthur and the devil cat of the Lake of Lausanne (in present-day Switzerland) is now considered to have been localized in near the Savoie region of France near Lake Bourget, where could be found the Mont du Chat [fr]. This conforms with the account in the Estoire de Merlin that Arthur, in order to commemorate his victory over the cat, renamed a place that was called Mont du Lac as Mont du Chat ('cat mountain').[56]
The modern rediscovery of the Arthurian lore here is credited to Emile Freymond [de], who initially searched for local tradition or onomastics around Lausanne, in vain, then crossing the border into France, and found this spot.[56] The community still retained vestigial lore of encounters with the monstrous cat, though Arthur did not figure in them. There was also a piece of 13th century writing by Etienne de Bourbon saying that King Arthur carried out a hunt at Mont du chat.[57][56]
The Welsh tradition gives as localisation the Isle of Anglesey but born at Llanveir.
Explanatory notes[edit]
^ Some words in the group are palu 'to dig' and paladr '(spear) shaft'.
^ In the group belongs the word palach ('club'; plural pelach glossed in Latin as clavae), which occurs in the nickname Pen-Pelach ('Cudgel-head'), which alongside Cath Palug is listed among Arthur's or Kay's enemies in the poem Pa Gur.[1][3]
^ Bromwich adds this is a case where a Welsh word of an entirely different meaning has been reinterpreted in French in a different meaning. Another example being Caradoc Vreichvras.
^ Llanfair-is-gaer, a former parish in Arfon (district), Gwynedd
^ Skene translated this as "ready", Bromwich as "a fragment(?) against".
^ a b Gaston Paris made the important connection comparing Manuel und Amande with the Anglo-Norman poem and the prose Merlin (Paris (G.) (1888), pp. 219–220), but did not extend the comparison to the Welsh sources. Connection to the Cath Palug of the Welsh were made by Nutt and by Freymond.[16][17]
^ Similarities in the personages involved (Arthur) and other motifs. A motif analysis is given for example in Freymond (1899), pp. 354–357
^ The lines in the poem skipped over by the commentators in ellipses explicitly state that the French were motivated patriotism and wished to "exact vengeance on the English" ("S'en volent vengier li Engleis).[27]
^ Michael Harney (Harney (2003)) credits María Rosa Lida de Malkiel with this observation. Charles Philip Wagner [es](1903), The Sources of El Cavallero Cifar, pp. 49–50 has noted this also.

Pet humanization
Pet humanization is a form of anthropomorphism in which pets, typically animals kept for companionship such as dogs, cats and even smaller animals like rabbits or hamsters, are treated more like human family members than traditional pets.[1] This trend of pet culture involves providing pets with a higher level of care, attention and often even luxury, similar to the way humans are treated.[2]

The phenomenon of pet humanization refers to pets kept for companionship that are treated, cared for and valued in a manner that mirrors the way humans are treated within a family or social context. It involves attributing human-like qualities, emotions and needs to pets and providing them with care, attention and comforts similar to those given to human family members.
In a pet-humanized context, pets are often regarded as beloved members of the family, rather than just animals or possessions.
It is important to note that pet humanization can have both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, it reflects a deep love and care for animals and can lead to improved welfare and well-being for pets. However, it can potentially lead to unrealistic expectations, anthropomorphism and overlooking the unique needs and behaviors of different species.
Overall, pet humanization is a complex and evolving cultural shift that reflects the evolving role of pets in modern society and the deep emotional connections people form with their animal companions.
History[edit]
The concept of pet humanization has evolved over time and is not tied to a specific date. However, there are certain periods and cultural shifts that have contributed to the rise of pet humanization.
Overall, while there is not a specific starting date for pet humanization, it can be understood as a gradual cultural shift that has evolved over centuries, with more pronounced developments occurring in recent history.

When people domesticate wild animals they bring them under control and use them to produce food or as pets. In the previous 11,000 years, humans have brought a wide range of species into domestication, which developed into an interspecies friendship using animals as pets and companions.[3]
The influence of human behaviour on domesticated animals has led to many species having learned to co-exist sometimes leading to the formation of an interspecies friendship. For example, interspecies friendships are often observed in humans with their domesticated pets and in pets that live in the same household such as cats and dogs.
In many ancient civilizations, people formed close bonds with animals, often using them for various purposes like hunting, protection, companionship and animal worship. For example, cats in ancient Egypt, showed humans with a deep reverence for cats, considering them as sacred animals that were deified as Bastet and providing them with elaborate burials.
Dogs in religion hold various symbolic and cultural meanings across different religions and belief systems.
The modern concept of pet humanization began to gain significant momentum in Western culture and societies during the 19th century and continued to grow throughout the 20th century. Industrialization, urbanization and changes in lifestyle led to a shift in how people perceived and interacted with their pets.
In the mid-20th century, the pet industry started to expand, offering a wide range of products and services catering to pet owners' desires to provide the best possible care for their animals. This included the development of specialized pet foods, veterinary medicine, grooming services and even luxury items.
The 20th and 21st centuries have seen a remarkable increase in the level of care, attention and even anthropomorphism directed toward pets. Many people now consider their pets to be family members and strive to provide them with a high quality of life.
In the modern era, this trend reflects changing societal attitudes towards pets, where they are seen less as a property and more as valued members of the family.[4] While this can enhance the well-being of pets through improved care and attention, there are debates about the potential downsides, such as overindulgence or attributing human emotions and needs to animals that might not share them in the same way.
It is important to note that while pet humanization can enhance the lives of pets and their owners, there are potential challenges, such as unrealistic expectations, the risk of anthropomorphism and the need to balance pets' natural behaviours and needs with human desires. As with any societal trend, there is a diversity of perspectives and practices regarding pet humanization within modern society.
Key aspects[edit]
Key aspects of pet humanization include owners that may prioritize premium or organic pet food, special diets and even prepare homemade meals for their pets.[5]
Pets receive regular check-ups, vaccinations and even medical treatments that were once uncommon.
Pets may have a wide array of accessories such as clothing, collars, leashes and even designer items. Luxurious pet accommodations, such as elaborate pet beds or specialized animal furniture, may be used.
Pets are provided with toys, entertainment and enrichment activities to keep them mentally stimulated.
Pets might have birthdays celebrated with parties, special treats and social gatherings.
Pet-friendly accommodations and travel arrangements are made for vacations or trips.
Pets may have their own social media profiles with followers and interactions.
Owners often form deep emotional bonds with their pets, considering them as family members and seeking companionship and emotional support from them.
Human psychology[edit]
The psychology behind pet humanization involves understanding the motivations, emotions and behaviours that drive individuals to treat their pets as more than just animals and instead as valued members of the family or even as surrogate companions.[6]

Humans have a natural inclination to form emotional bonds with other living beings and pets often provide unconditional love, companionship and a sense of belonging. This emotional connection can lead to the desire to provide the best possible care and attention to pets.[7] Anthropomorphism is the tendency to attribute human-like qualities, emotions and intentions to non-human entities, including animals. When people anthropomorphize their pets, they may interpret their behaviours as if they were human and project their own emotions onto them, strengthening the bond between owner and pet.[8] Loneliness is a common human experience and pets can provide meaningful companionship and social relation. This is especially relevant in modern urban environments where people may have fewer opportunities for social connections.
Owning a pet, especially one that is pampered and well-cared-for, can be a source of status and identity for some individuals. Displaying care and love for pets can reflect positively on an owner's values and lifestyle.
For many people, caring for a pet can evoke similar emotions and instincts as parenting a child. This can lead to the desire to provide the best possible care, including high-quality food, medical attention and emotional support.
Societal trends and marketing play a role in shaping perceptions of how pets should be treated. Advertisements, social media and popular culture often portray pets in human-like roles, influencing people's expectations and behaviours.
Interacting with pets has been shown to have positive effects on human well-being, including reducing stress, anxiety and even improving physical health. Treating pets as family members may be a way for individuals to enhance their own emotional well-being.
The loss of a pet can evoke intense grief and sadness. Treating pets as family members may help individuals cope with the eventual loss by ensuring they provide the best care and attention during their pets' lives.
It is important to note that while pet humanization can have many positive effects on both humans and pets, it can lead to unrealistic expectations, overindulgence and potential misunderstandings about the true nature of animal behaviour and needs. Striking a balance between providing quality care and maintaining a realistic understanding of pets' biological and emotional needs is crucial for the well-being of both owners and animals.
Anthrozoology[edit]
Anthrozoology is the interdisciplinary study of the interactions and relationships between humans and animals. It encompasses a wide range of topics related to human-animal interactions, including the emotional, psychological, social and biological aspects of these relationships.[9] Pet humanization is a concept within the field of anthrozoology that focuses on the tendency of humans to attribute human-like qualities and behaviours to their pets.
Within the realm of anthrozoology, pet humanization is a multifaceted concept that reflects the complex and dynamic relationships between humans and their pets. This phenomenon showcases the unique ways in which humans engage with animals emotionally, socially and culturally, shedding light on the intricate interplay between human perceptions, behaviours and the well-being of both humans and animals.

Anthrozoologists study the emotional bond between humans and their pets, exploring how this bond is formed and the benefits it provides to both humans and animals. Pet humanization is a natural outcome of this emotional bond, as people often treat their pets as family members or companions with whom they share strong emotional connections.
Anthrozoology examines how pets influence human social interactions and relationships. Pets often serve as conversation starters and can facilitate social interactions among people. Pet humanization can be observed in the way people talk about their pets and share stories about their behaviors, as if they were discussing human experiences.
The study of anthrozoology delves into how pets contribute to human psychological well-being. The act of petting a dog or interacting with a cat, for example, can have calming and stress-reducing effects. Pet humanization comes into play as people interpret their pets' behaviours and expressions in ways that resonate with their own emotional experiences.
Anthrozoologists investigate how humans and animals communicate and understand each other. Pet humanization often involves interpreting pets' vocalizations, body language and behaviours as if they were forms of human communication, leading to a deeper sense of connection between humans and their pets.
The concept of pet humanization can vary across cultures and societies. Anthrozoologists analyze how cultural norms and societal values shape the ways in which people humanize their pets. For instance, in some cultures, pets may be treated as working animals rather than companions, leading to different forms of human-animal interaction.
Anthrozoology address ethical questions related to the treatment of animals as humanized beings. This includes discussions about whether anthropomorphism enhances or distorts our understanding of animal behaviour and needs.
Pet food industry[edit]
Pet humanization has had a significant impact on the pet food industry, leading to changes in consumer preferences, product offerings and marketing strategies.[10] As pet owners increasingly view their pets as integral members of their families, they seek out higher quality and more specialized food options for their pet companions.[11]

Pet owners who humanize their pets often seek pet foods made with high-quality, natural and wholesome ingredients.[12] This has led to a rise in demand for premium pet foods that are free from artificial additives, preservatives and fillers.
Just as humans have diverse dietary needs, pets with specific health conditions or dietary requirements have led to the development of specialized diets. These diets address issues such as allergies, sensitivities, weight management and age-related concerns.
Pet humanization has prompted increased demand for transparency regarding the sourcing and production of pet food. Consumers want to know where ingredients come from and how the food is made, leading to a push for clearer labelling and more information on packaging.
Some pet food companies offer customizable options, allowing pet owners to tailor their pets' diets based on factors like breed, age, activity level and health needs.
As pets are treated more like family members, the demand for pet treats and snacks that resemble human foods has increased. This includes products like gourmet biscuits, cookies and jerky made from quality ingredients.
Pet food companies have adjusted their marketing strategies to cater to pet humanization trends. Advertisements often emphasize the health benefits and nutritional value of their products, showcasing real ingredients and portraying pets as cherished companions.
The pet food industry has seen a shift toward premiumization, with higher-quality products commanding higher price points. Pet owners who humanize their pets are often willing to invest more in their pets' nutrition and well-being.
Some human food trends have crossed over to the pet food industry, such as grain-free, gluten-free and organic options.
Pet foods are being formulated with functional ingredients like antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics, mirroring the trends in human health and nutrition.
The convenience of online shopping and home delivery has gained popularity, allowing pet owners to easily access a wide variety of pet food options tailored to their preferences.
Pet health care[edit]
Pet health care and pet humanization has had a notable impact on the health care of pets, leading to changes in how pet owners approach veterinary care, preventive measures, medical treatments and overall wellness for their furry companions.[13] Pet owners who humanize their pets are more likely to prioritize preventive veterinary care. They schedule regular check-ups, vaccinations, dental cleanings and screenings to catch potential health issues early.
Pet humanization has led to increased willingness to pursue advanced medical treatments for pets. This includes surgeries, specialized procedures and treatments for chronic conditions that were once considered cost-prohibitive. Some pet owners explore holistic and integrative therapies, including acupuncture, chiropractic care, herbal medicine and alternative treatments alongside conventional veterinary care.
The emphasis on pet well-being has spurred the growth of wellness-focused products such as supplements, probiotics and specialty diets designed to promote optimal health.
Pet humanization has led to a desire for personalized care plans tailored to each pet's individual needs, taking into consideration factors like age, breed, lifestyle and medical history.
As pet owners consider pets to be family members, many opt for pet health insurance to provide financial support for unexpected medical expenses.
Pet humanization has highlighted the importance of addressing pets' behavioral and mental health. This has led to increased awareness of issues like anxiety, depression and stress in pets and a focus on behavioral training and enrichment activities. Pet humanization has also influenced end-of-life care decisions. Pet owners are more likely to opt for palliative care, hospice services and euthanasia procedures that prioritize comfort and dignity for pets in their final moments.
Pet owners who humanize their pets often seek out extensive information about pet health, wellness and medical conditions through online resources, forums and consultations with veterinarians.
With pets living longer due to improved medical care, pet humanization has prompted an increased focus on geriatric care, addressing the unique needs of older pets, such as mobility issues, pain management and cognitive health.
As pets become integral emotional supports for their owners, there's a growing recognition of the role pets play in human mental health. Some pet owners seek guidance from veterinarians on how to ensure their pets' emotional well-being. [14]

Pet insurance is considered a component of pet humanization because it reflects the growing trend of treating pets as members of the family and providing them with similar care and services that humans receive.[15] Just as humans have health insurance to cover medical expenses, pet owners now seek pet insurance to provide financial coverage for unexpected veterinary bills. This reflects the desire to ensure that their pets have access to quality healthcare and treatment, similar to the concern for human family members.
In essence, pet insurance fits into the broader concept of pet humanization because it embodies the idea that pets are not just animals, but cherished members of the family who deserve access to high-quality medical care and a comfortable life.
The emotional connection drives pet owners to want the best for their animals, including access to medical care that can prolong and enhance their pets' lives.
Providing medical care for pets can be expensive, especially in the case of unexpected illnesses or accidents. Pet insurance helps alleviate the financial burden, allowing pet owners to make healthcare decisions based on the pet's needs rather than solely on cost considerations.
Many pet insurance policies also cover preventive services like vaccinations, regular check-ups, and dental care. This emphasis on preventive care aligns with the trend of prioritizing wellness and proactive healthcare for pets.
Pet insurance policies can cover a range of medical treatments, surgeries, and medications. This level of coverage aligns with the desire to provide comprehensive medical care, mirroring the type of healthcare humans receive.
Pet owners want peace of mind, knowing that they can provide the best possible care for their pets in times of need. Just as humans value insurance for security, pet owners see pet insurance as a means to ensure the well-being of their animal companions.
Pet humanization has led to a more comprehensive and individualized approach to pet health care, including preventive measures, advanced treatments, wellness products and holistic considerations. This trend underscores the evolving relationship between pets and their owners and highlights the importance of providing the best possible care for animal family members.
Pet bereavement[edit]
Main articles: Animal loss and Rainbow Bridge (pets)
The Rainbow Bridge is a meadow where animals wait for their humans to join them and the bridge that takes them all to Heaven, together.[16]
Pet bereavement and pet humanization are two concepts that are closely related and often intersect in the realm of human-pet relationships.[17][18][19]
Pet bereavement is the emotional response that pet owners experience when their pets pass away. It involves a range of emotions similar to the mourning process for a human loved one. Pet owners may experience sadness, guilt, anger, denial and depression when they lose their beloved animal companion. This grieving process can be very intense and lasting, as the bond between humans and their pets can be deeply emotional and meaningful.[20][21]
The correlation between pet humanization and pet bereavement lies in the emotional connection between humans and their pets. When pets are humanized, they become integral members of the family and the bond between humans and pets becomes stronger. As a result, the loss of a pet can be felt just as deeply as the loss of a human family member. The more a pet is treated like a human, the more the grieving process might resemble that of human bereavement.[22]
Pet humanization can contribute to the intensity of pet grieving. When pets are considered family members, the emotional investment and attachment are heightened. This intensifies the grief experienced when the pet passes away.
Moreover, the concept of pet humanization can impact how people handle the grieving process. Humanizing a pet might lead to more elaborate memorial services, rituals and expressions of grief, similar to how humans are mourned. People might bury their pet in a pet cemetery, create memorials, write eulogies, or even seek professional help to cope with their grief over the loss of a pet.[23]
Death, culture and pet humanization are distinct concepts, but they can be correlated through the ways in which cultures perceive and handle the death of pets, which are often considered as family members and thus experience some degree of humanization. This emerges from the evolving ways in which cultures treat and perceive pets, leading to more nuanced and emotionally charged experiences when pets pass away. This intersection demonstrates the dynamic interplay between our cultural beliefs, practices and emotional connections to our animal companions.
Some cultures and religions might have elaborate ceremonies or rituals to honour deceased pets, while others may view such practices as unusual. These variations showcase how the intersection of pet humanization and death is influenced by cultural norms and beliefs.
The correlation between pet humanization and pet bereavement is rooted in the deep emotional connection people have with their pets. Treating pets as family members leads to stronger emotional bonds, which in turn can amplify the grieving process when the pet passes away.
Animal welfare and ethics[edit]
Animal welfare and ethics lies in finding a balance between treating pets with care, love and respect while ensuring that their needs of physical, emotional and autonomy are not compromised due to well-intentioned but potentially misguided humanization practices.[24]
Pet humanization can have both positive and negative effects on animal welfare. Positive aspects might include increased attention, care, and access to veterinary services. However, negative aspects can arise if humanization practices lead to situations where the animal's natural behaviours, health or comfort are compromised.
Humanization practices such as feeding pets human food or dressing them in clothing can lead to health issues. Research in this area might investigate the nutritional needs of pets and how to strike a balance between treating pets well and ensuring their physical health.
While pets do form emotional bonds with humans, attributing overly complex human emotions to animals can be ethically problematic. Misinterpreting their behaviours as solely driven by human-like emotions might lead to incorrect judgments about their well-being.
Ethical concerns arise when humanization interferes with an animal's natural behaviours and autonomy. For example, dressing a dog in clothes might restrict their movement, interrupt their ability to regulate body temperature, cause a skin condition or stress to the animal. Further research might explore how to enrich pets' lives while respecting their species-specific behaviours.
Humanization practices can lead to dilemmas, such as cosmetic surgeries for pets or extreme grooming practices. Ethical considerations involve questioning whether such practices prioritize the animal's well-being or human aesthetic preferences.
The pet industry responds to consumer demand for human-like products and services for pets. Businesses must balance this demand with ethical considerations, ensuring that products and services cater to pets' needs rather than human whims.
Educating pet owners about responsible pet humanization, which includes raising awareness about the importance of considering the animal's perspective, promoting positive behaviours and discouraging practices that could harm pets.
As pet humanization practices evolve, ethical guidelines and regulations might need to be developed or updated to ensure that pet owners provide an environment that aligns with animals' natural behaviours and needs.
Ethical considerations can guide research priorities in understanding the effects of humanization on animals. For instance, studies might focus on evaluating the impact of certain practices on animals' quality of life and well-being.

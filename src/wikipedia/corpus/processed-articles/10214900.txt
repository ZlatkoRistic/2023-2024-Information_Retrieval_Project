The Kuching Cat Museum (Malay: Muzium Kucing Kuching) is a cat museum in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. It was founded in 1993. It is owned by the Kuching North City Hall (DBKU).
History[edit]
Main entrance to Kuching Cat Museum in 2009
The idea of building a cat museum was mooted by Sarawak chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud and his wife Laila Taib.[1]
Collections[edit]

There are four galleries containing over 4,000 artefacts including paintings and memorials related to cats. Exhibits include a mummified cat from ancient Egypt, a gallery of feline-related advertising, and the five species of wild cats found in Borneo. These artefacts were acquired from National Museum in Kuala Lumpur and were displayed for the first time on 1 August 1988 at Dewan Tun Abdul Razak, Putra World Trade Centre. The collections were handed over to DBKU after the completion of DBKU headquarters in 1992.[1]
Structure[edit]
The museum is currently housed on the bottom floor of the Kuching North City Hall, located in Petra Jaya, about 20 minutes away from the Kuching Waterfront. The museum covers an area of 1,035 square metres on Bukit Siol which is 60 metres above sea level.[1] The museum is RM1.00 for entry, which also includes a DBKU Cat Museum keychain.

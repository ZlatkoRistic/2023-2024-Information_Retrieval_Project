Winnie (feline)
Supposed big cat sighted in the Veluwe region of the Netherlands
Faulhaber's photographic evidence
In 2005, Winnie was the name given to a supposed big cat sighted in the Veluwe region of the Netherlands.
Sightings[edit]
At the beginning of June 2005, several sightings of a "puma" were reported to the police near Ede, Harskamp and Wekerom. Spoor was said to have been found.[1] The police closed down a large part of the Ginkelse HeideÂ [nl] while in search of the animal in order to shoot it, as they felt that a puma could be a threat to people living in the Veluwe area. However, no trace of the animal was found. An additional search for the animal was performed by the organization Pantera,[2] but was also unsuccessful, although a further sighting was reported in September.[3]
Cage With No Puma in It, sculpture by Maarten de Reus in Apeldoorn
Explanation[edit]
On September 21, 2005, an analysis by biologist Gerrit Jansen of high-resolution photos taken by wildlife photographer Otto Faulhaber explained the supposed puma as being a cross-breed between a European wildcat and a typical housecat. The cat was 1.5 times as big as a normal house cat, which may have convinced those who saw it that they were looking at a species of big cat.[4][5][6] European wildcats do not appear in the Netherlands in great numbers, but occasionally they can be seen.
Sculpture[edit]
The story of Winnie inspired the Amsterdam artist Maarten de Reus to design a wire sculpture titled Kooi-met-geen-poema-er-in (Cage With No Puma in It), which was erected in a park in the Zuidbroek section of Apeldoorn. It was awarded the 2008 National Steel Prize and the 2009 National Building Prize.[7]

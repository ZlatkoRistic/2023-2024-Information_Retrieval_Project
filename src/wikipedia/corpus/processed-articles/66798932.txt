Litter-Robot is a gravity-driven sifting automatic litter box manufactured and distributed by Whisker based in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
History[edit]
Litter-Robot was first released in 2000.[1] Brad Baxter, who brought the product to market, licensed an existing patent and developed the device.[1] He funded the first generation of the Litter-Robot with an investment from his parents.[2] Baxter sold the Litter-Robot online directly to consumers, and the business became profitable in 2005.[3] There have been four iterations of the Litter-Robot since its release.[4]
In 2019, Litter-Robot manufacturer Whisker (formerly AutoPets)[5] raised $31 million in growth equity financing from Chicago-based Pondera Holdings LLC.[3] In 2022, the company completed a $10 million investment to expand its manufacturing plant in Juneau, Wisconsin.[6]
The latest iteration of the product, Litter-Robot 4, was released in 2022. [7] Whisker announced in 2023 that 1 million Litter-Robot units have been sold since the company’s inception. [6]
The product is sold in ten countries, including in the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, and China.[8] The company has more than 400 full-time employees in the United States.[6]
Reception[edit]
Good Housekeeping called Litter-Robot 4 “the best overall self-cleaning litter box.”[9] It was awarded as one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2022.[10] The Spruce Pets rated Litter-Robot 4 the “best overall” automatic litter box with 4.8 stars. [11] Forbes called it “a smart litter box that's worth the investment” while Engadget said it is “great but imperfect.” [12] [13]

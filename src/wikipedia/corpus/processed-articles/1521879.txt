Caracal caracalâ™‚ Ã— Leptailurus servalâ™€
The caraval (also called a cara-serval) is the hybrid cross between a male caracal and a female serval. They have a spotted pattern similar to the serval, but on a darker background.[1][2][3][4]
A servical[5] is the cross between a male serval and a female caracal.[6][7][8] A litter of servicals occurred by accident when the two animals were kept in the same enclosure at Los Angeles Zoo. The hybrids were given to an animal shelter. The only photos show them as tawny kittens.
Several serval - caracal offspring have been born in recent years through a breeding program in order to create F1 hybrids. So far; no F1 hybrids of this cross breed are in existence.[9]

This is a complete list of cat registries worldwide. A cat registry's purpose is to register purebred cats which are recognized by the organization. The first cat registry was the National Cat Club, set up in 1887 in England. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy was established in 1910. The National Cat Club was also the governing body of the cat fancy. Another registry called the Cat Club was started in 1898.[1]
Present day[edit]
In the 21st century there are many cat registries. The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes 71 standardized breeds,[2] the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 44,[3] and the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) recognizes 43.[4] The New Zealand Cat Fancy recognizes and registers 55 cat breeds.[5]

C-Boy (d. June 2018, age ~14) was a lion in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.[1][2] He is known for having survived an attack from a pack of three male lions, nicknamed "The Killers", in August 2009.[3] He later nearly succumbed to infection after the attack. A decade later, C-Boy was found dead due to unknown causes.[1] Photographer Nick Nichols took pictures of him during visits to the Serengeti between 2011 and 2013.[4][5]

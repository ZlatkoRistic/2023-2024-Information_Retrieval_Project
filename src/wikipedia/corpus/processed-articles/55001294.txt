List of oldest cats
This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.
This is a list of the oldest cats in the world, verified or not, listed by reported age, all of whom have attained the minimum age of 25 years. Aging in cats depends on breed, size and diet.
Some of the ages reported here are approximate. Others are based on estimates or hearsay. Few of them have been confirmed by any authoritative agency. Creme Puff (1967–2005) of Austin, Texas, is the oldest verified cat ever, while Flossie (born 29 December 1995) is the oldest living fully verified cat as of 2022 at nearly 27 years.

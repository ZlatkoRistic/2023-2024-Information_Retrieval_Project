Biography[edit]
Stepan was born in 2008 in Kharkiv. Stepan's owner, Anna, found him when he was little.[5] He has since lived with her in a high-rise apartment building in Saltivka, Kharkiv.[6] In 2020, during the quarantine period, Anna recorded the first video of Stepan, and it received several million views. Since then, Anna has been posting new photos and taking pictures of Stepan almost every day, always coming up with new images for Stepan.[3] Initially Anna posted in Russian.[4]
According to The Moscow Times' YouTube channel, by July 2021, the cat's fame had crossed the country's borders, with Stepan "capturing the heart" of the Russian Internet.[7]
In November 2021, Britney Spears drew attention to the cat in her post.[8] The publication had more than 1.1 million likes and almost nine thousand comments.[9] Soon after, the Italian fashion house Valentino published an ad for one of its handbags, featuring the cat Stepan.[1]
On February 24, 2022, Anna and Stepan were surprised by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, during which violent bombings are being carried out in Kharkiv, with the destruction of part of the city, including residential neighborhoods, causing dozens of deaths and injuries. After the invasion began, Stepan's social media accounts confirmed that both the cat and its owner survived the bombings, finding themselves in a shelter. Stepan's photos have been accompanied by photos of the destruction caused by Russian forces, and messages calling for an end to the invasion and a return to peace.[10][11] After Stepan and his family escaped to Poland, the World Influencers and Bloggers Association helped them find a safe house in France.[6][12]
Following the Russian invasion the social media posts of Stepan switched to Ukrainian.[4] Stepan's owner Anna told the BBC "We've all changed mentally after seeing what sort of thing this 'Russian world' (a concept of a cultural and political space promoted by Russia) really is."[4]
In August 2022, Anna adopted a kitten, Stephania; she is a tabby and looks a lot like Stepan.[13] In November of that year, Stepan was appointed as an 'ambassador' by the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy as part of their 'Save Ukrainian Culture' campaign.[14]
In 2022 Stepan's social media pages helped raise almost 15,000 euros for food, medicine and other care for other Ukrainian animals who suffered in the war.[4]

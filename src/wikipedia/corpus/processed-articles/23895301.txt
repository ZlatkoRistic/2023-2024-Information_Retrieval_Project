The Southern Africa Cat Council (SACC) is a cat registry and cat fancy organisation based in South Africa, affiliating 9 clubs, 14 breed groups and 4 judges panels.
History[edit]
SACC was founded in 1945 as the Associated Cat Clubs of South Africa, the first organisation serving the South African cat fancy.
In 1996, the members overhauled the organisation's structure and constitution, and adopted the name Southern African Cat Council.[1]
SACC joined the World Cat Congress in 2006.

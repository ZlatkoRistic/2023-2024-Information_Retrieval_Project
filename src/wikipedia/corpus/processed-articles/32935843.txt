Zouyu (Chinese: 騶虞), also called zouwu (騶吾) or zouya (騶牙), is a legendary creature mentioned in old Chinese literature. The earliest known appearance of the characters 騶虞 (zou yu) is in the Book of Songs,[1][2] but J.J.L. Duyvendak describes that the interpretation of that little poem as referring to an animal of that name is "very doubtful".[1]
Zouyu appears in a number of later works, where it is described as
"righteous" animal, which, similarly to a qilin, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be as fierce-looking as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books (already in Shuowen Jiezi[3]) as a white tiger with black spots.[1]
In 1404, during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, Prince Zhu Su, his relative from Kaifeng (in modern-day Henan province) sent him a captured zouyu spotted and captured in Shenhou [zh]; an anonymous painter later painted that zouyu, which was evidently a rare white tiger.[1][4] Another zouyu was sighted in Shandong.[1] The zouyu sightings were mentioned by contemporaneous authors as good omens, along with the Yellow River running clear and the delivery of a qilin (i.e., an African giraffe) by a Bengal delegation that arrived to China aboard Zheng He's fleet.[1]
Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the zouyu said to be captured during the Yongle era,
Duyvendak exclaims, "Can it possibly have been a Pandah?"[1] Following him, some modern authors consider zouyu to refer to the giant panda.[5]
Sinologist and linguist Wolfgang Behr includes the zouyu ~ zouwu ~ zouya among several leophoric names, besides 獅子 shī-zǐ and 狻猊 suān-ní, in ancient Chinese texts to denote lions.[6]
Riordan & Shi (2016) propose that Zou Yu ("驺瑜 [sic]")[a] and other words for some enigmatic pantherine predators in ancient Chinese texts[b] possibly denoted snow leopards.[8][c]
Popular culture[edit]
The creature appears in the 2018 fantasy film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald as an elephant-sized cat resembling a lion/tiger mix with large eyes, four upper tusks, and a ruffled tail (resembling those of Chinese guardian lions and those from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings three years later on) and has the ability to apparate.[14]
Notes[edit]
^ Riordan & Shi mistakenly give the pinyin transcription of 驺虞 (variants: 驺吾 ~ 騶吾[7]) in the Classic of Mountains and Seas as Zhu Jian instead of Zou Yu.
^ For examples, the
Meng Ji (孟極) in the Classic of Mountains and Seas; the Zun Er ("拵栭 [sic]"[8] ~ "尊耳";[9] rendered "酋耳" (Qiu Er) in Siku Quanshu version[10]) in Lost Book of Zhou, and the Pi Xiu (貔貅) in Records of the Grand Historian.[11]
^ Riordan & Shi also state that the snow leopards were named Ai Ye Bao (艾叶豹 ~ 艾葉豹, "common mugwort leaves leopards") in Li Shizhen's Bencao Gangmu[12][13] as well as He Ye Bao (荷叶豹 ~ 荷葉豹).[8]
